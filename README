README for Set::Object 1.17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There used to be a reproduction of the man page here, but that's just
silly.

So now I guess I should put the normal things here, like how to
install the module, etc.

Oh, look, just go and read another module's README.  It's just the
same, honest.  Nothing to see here, move along.

Cheers,
Sam.
